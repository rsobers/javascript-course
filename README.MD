[Jon Ducket, JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development, First Edition, 2014](http://javascriptbook.com/buy/)

We will also make use of free online training materials.

### Laptop

To explore and implement the topics we will be discussing in class, you will need a laptop. During
the course we will make use of the Sublime Text 3 text editor and the Google Chrome web browser to develop and run our programs.

[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) is freely available for Windows, Mac, and Linux (including Chromebooks).

## Course Description

How can we automatically solve problems using computers? By the end of this course, students should be able to implement solutions to solve basic computational problems using the JavaScript programming language. Students will learn to design, implement, document and test programs, as well as learn to apply language concepts such as iteration, decision, functions, and arrays. No previous programming experience is expected.

## Learning Objectives

**Essential Question:** How can we automatically solve problems using computers?

By the end of the course, you should be able to implement solutions to solve basic computational
problems, including manipulating web pages, making interactive web applications, and interacting with third-party services.

You will learn JavaScript, a popular and easy-to-use web programming language, and use it to implement your algorithms. You will learn to read and write JavaScript and execute programs using the Google Chrome web browser and its built-in web inspector and debugger.

## Assessment

**Participation & Attendance:** 10% Learning begins with your preparation before class with practice homework exercises which we will continue exploring during class as well as trying new activities. Students should come to class prepared to answer questions and work through exercises. Attendance and effort to learn are both necessary for participation. You are permitted three unexcused absences with prior notice before class time, all other absences must be through academic services.

**Practice Homework & Enrichment:** 0% The best way to learn computer science & assess your own progress in understanding the material is by doing. Before each class I will assign practice HWs to begin working with the concepts, and during class we will deepen your understanding by discussing them. For those students interested in additional practice outside of class time, extra credit enrichment exercises are available through the computer science tutors for each module.

**Homework:** 20% Like any skill, learning to program takes constant practice. Graded homeworks
may make use of the free online exercises using sites like CodeAcademy or code.org. Graded HWs
will typically be assigned before a topic is covered in class to begin introducing a topic.

**Projects:** 20% You will be given numerous opportunities to practice programming both in class and
at home. The next step is to demonstrate your mastery by completing a brief programming exercise
during class or a lengthier one out of class. Some projects will be individual, some in teams. Late
penalty is 25% per day late (applied after midnight), with 10% after the deadline on the first day.

**Mid-term:** 25% After demonstrating mastery through homework and projects, the next step is to assess your mastery of the concepts without a computer.

**Final Exam:** 25% After demonstrating mastery of concepts throughout the semester, you have an additional opportunity to demonstrate your mastery on a final exam.

**Final Grades.** Letter grades will be assigned based on mastery: exceptional (A), complete (B), almost complete with minor mistakes (C), little mastery with effort (D), no mastery and little effort (F). *Your final grade cannot be more than a letter grade higher than your exam letter grade.*

## Building a Learning Community

**In-class use of technology.** You are expected to use a laptop during class to work through examples and practice coding on assignments. Using technology such as laptops, tablets, and phones for nonclass activities significantly limits your in class learning opportunities. Come to class prepared to be mentally engaged the entire time, and limit unrelated technology use to before or after class.

**Academic Honesty.** Your work in this course is subject to Drew’s academic honesty policy. Drew’s standards and procedures are posted on the CLA Dean’s UKnow space. If I suspect for any reason that you have submitted work that isn’t yours or that otherwise violates Drew’s policy, I am required to report my suspicion to the Dean of the College. Copied work will receive no credit, both for the original source and the copied version. Don’t be afraid to discuss course topics with your peers or to google for help, but your assignments should be your own. The key is understanding the concepts enough to adapt them to new situations (such as on an exam or quiz).

**Academic Accommodations.** Should you require academic accommodations, you must file a request with the Office of Disability Services (BC 119, extension 3962). It is your responsibility to selfidentify with the [Office of Disability Services](http://www.drew.edu/academicservices/disabilityservices/register) & provide faculty with appropriate documentation from that office at least one week prior to any request for specific course accommodations. There are no retroactive accommodations.
